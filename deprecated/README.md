<h1 align=center>About Deprecated Documentation</h1>

## What are these documentations?

These documentation is the TensorSpace preprocess documentation before TensorSpace-Converter released. After TensorSpace-Converter released, you can use TensorSpace-Converter to preprocess pre-trained model for TensorSpace, so these documentation are deprecated.

## Why put here?

The theory of TensorSpace-Converter is exactly the same as the previous documentation, these documentations help to explain how TensorSpace-Converter works essentially.

## Who may interest?

If you just want to use TensorSpace-Converter to convert a pre-trained for TensorSpace, you don't need to read these deprecated preprocess documentation. If you are interested in what the TensorSpace-Converter do to pre-trained model or willing to contribute to TensorSpace-Converter, we high recommend you to read these documentations.
