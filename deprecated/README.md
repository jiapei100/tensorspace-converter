<h1 align=center>About Deprecated Documentations</h1>

These documentations are the TensorSpace preprocess documentations before TensorSpace-Converter released. After TensorSpace-Converter released, you can use TensorSpace-Converter to preprocess pre-trained models for TensorSpace, so these documentations are deprecated.

The underlying technique of TensorSpace-Converter is exactly the same as the previous documentations, so these documentations help to explain how TensorSpace-Converter works.

If you are interested in what the TensorSpace-Converter do to pre-trained model or willing to contribute to TensorSpace-Converter, we highly recommend to glance over these documentations.
